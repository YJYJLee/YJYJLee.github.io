<!-- write your biography here. tell the world about yourself. link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. you can put a picture in, too. the code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

put your address / p.o. box / other info right below your picture. you can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the yaml header of your `_pages/about.md`. edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

link to your social media connections, too. this theme is set up to use [font awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/font-awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. add your facebook, twitter, linkedin, google scholar, or just disable all of them.

 Yejin is a Ph.D candidate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University working with [Professor Jae W. Lee](https://iamjaelee.github.io/www/){:target="\_blank"}. 

 Her current research area includes hardware-software co-design for big data analytics and machine learning. Specifically, her research aims to accelerate such domains by identifying the relative criticality of the data and supporting critical data with specialized hardware architectures. 

 Her research has been recognized with an IEEE Micro Top Picks distinction and has appeared in top computer architecture and systems venues like ASPLOS and ISCA.
